ArduinoCompilationWithAVR
=========================

This project shows how you can compile an Arduino program with AVR-GCC.<br/>
The advantages of this solution are :
<ul>
	<li>The software upload is easier for the user (just a file to upload, no need libraries and program compilation)</li>
	<li>The software deployment without the program source</li>
	<li>You don't need user interface to compile and upload program into the arduino board</li>
</ul>
